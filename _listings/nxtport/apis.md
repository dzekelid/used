- name: T-mining Secure Container Release API (live) - Create an Event
  x-api-slug: apiv1events-post
  description: |-
    Used to create an event for a container at a specific location and time.
    Each event is defined by a type.
    Currently a limited number of events (pickup and availability) are supported, but this may be extended with e.g. passage events.
    There are 2 ways to refer to a Container: by means of its id as defined in the Blockchain (this requires recording these ids in your app), or by means of a combination of the blNumber and isoNumber. Similarly, locations can be specified in 2 ways: by means of their id as defined in the Blockchain or by means of their name. In the latter case the name must be defined in a mapping   file for the Organization you - as a user- belong to. Also note that the container may not yet be known in the Blockchain at the time
    an availability event is created!
